  <b>The game ends when the spy is either 1) eliminated or 2) among the two remaining players.</b>
  <br/><br/>
  Each player is given a word on the app. One person <b>("the Spy")</b> is shown a word which is slightly different word. This word is in some way related to the original word.
  <br/><br/>
  <b>The catch:</b> no one knows if they are the spy!
  <br/><br/>
  When everyone has seen their word, each player to make a statement about that word (e.g. 'he is a famous actor', 'it is something you can eat'). After every round of statements a player is voted out and the app will reveal if that player were the spy or not.
